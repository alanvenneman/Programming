Unique ID Maker:

Inputs: subdivision feature layer (NAME_SEC)

Use the slice function to get the first three letters off the name. Each slice will need a six-digit random number assigned to it, followed by an 'S' for subdivision. (Later we will add in the 'R' for Road)

We open up one for loop, search cursor to find the NAME_SEC, update cursor to populate SUBDIV_LEGAL_NAME.

For the Roadways, we will need to enter in all the nearby subdivisions into an Excel file, paste in the necessary number of six digit random/unique numbers, and add the R at the end. We can do a macro or simple concatentation to generate a list of UIDs. Then we will need to enter them into Alchemy.
